If we cant show real results -> experimentals results are ok
Explain the diff scenarios for the presentation

Generalize the idea, less specific problematic
smart door 	-> switch to open/lock
		-> ultrasonic sensor
		-> motor
		-> keypad

-> same thing but we use switch to lock and unlock the door

Draw scheme in proposal until next week

--> Maybe add buzzer, for wrong password 


Multiple scenarios:
Opening
Closing
Locking
Unlocking
Detect something for opening




Dans le 2e rendu, faire des diagrammes
-> Opening diagram
-> Interraction diagrams


-> Try to use all of them in the implementation
